## About

DresdenStory is an app to get to know or rediscover the most exciting places in Dresden in a different and more interactive way compared to regular city guides. To reach this aim we utilized storytelling (the different points are chapters in a connected narrative), images and challenges (questions that need to be answered after each chapter) to let users enjoy the experience of getting to know or rediscovering Dresden.

This project was created by Ana Pinilla and Valerian Lange as part of the [Cartography M.Sc. programme](https://cartographymaster.eu/).

The app was written in Java only (no Kotlin), as this was a course requirement and helps to make the code approachable for beginners.
The app was written for Android 12 (API level 31).

## Functions

The user interface of the app is structured into three main activities:

### Map activity
