They just started their walk near the Altmarkt as Helga has a flat nearby and discuss her youth in Dresden.</p> <p>Lukas: Wow, grandma, so you're really saying this whole area was in ruins after the war?</p> <p>Helga: Yes, exactly, most of the inner city was destroyed during the bombings. The buildings you see here were among the first to be rebuilt in the 1950s, for example Haus Altmarkt:</p> <img src='chapter1_image1' alt='Haus Altmarkt'> <p>Lukas: Oh, interesting, so this was also built in the German Democratic Republic (GDR)? Because it doesn't look like the architecture I would have expected!</p> <p>Helga: Yes, in the early years after the war, the GDR also built houses in a historicist style. Also the decorations of this house show what was important to people after the war: To relax and have a good time as is symbolized with drinking and making music here.</p> <img src='chapter1_image2' alt='Altmarkt sculptures'> <p>Lukas: Haha, nice, I didn't notice that before!</p> <p>Helga: On the other side of the square you can also see the Kulturpalast, which is the more famous kind of GDR architecture, but let's walk for a bit before we talk about it more.</p>", "What was one of the earliest buildings to be built after World War Two called again?", "You can check the story text or look at the writing between the statues in the image.", "hausaltmarkt,housealtmarkt", false);

Don't we have murals all over town?</p> <p>Helga: Well, I think this building emphasizes some aspects of the GDR quite well. The Kulturpalast was quite unusual in its time because it wasn't built as a high-rise building in Stalinist style as originally intended but follows the International Style. It still has some socialist ideas integrated, for example the literally and figuratively transparent facade. And this influence of GDR doctrine is even more clear in this mural showing important moments and figures of GDR history.</p> <img src='chapter2_image1' alt='The Way of The Red Flag'> <p>Lukas: Okay, I see now why you wanted to show me this! How was growing up in the GDR anyways?</p> <p>Helga: Like with this building, there were two sides to the same coin. On one hand, there were very progressive and plausible concepts. But on the other hand, they were often driven by necessity and the totalitarian government didn't allow for alternative opinions to what was dictated by them.</p> <p>Lukas: That sounds harsh, grandma! How do you feel about the reunification then?</p> <p>Helga: That is a two-sided thing as well, I'd say.
